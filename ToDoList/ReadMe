To-Do List Web page

What I used
  HTML
  CSS
  JavaScript
  jQuery.js
  
Created a dynamic To-do list web app with styling done with CSS and CSS animations

Allows the user to add item to the list using a jQuery click event listener alonside an append() function to add the list item 

Includes a feature to grey out and line through the text by clicking on the item

When a list item is hovered over, a garbage bin icon animates into view using CSS. Uses the jQuery remove() function to delete the list item
from the unordered list

There is an included plus icon that can be used to hide the text field for items; this is using a click event listener alongside a fadeToggle()
from jQuery
